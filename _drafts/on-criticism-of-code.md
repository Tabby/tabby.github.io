When rewriting, refactoring, or otherwise working on existing code, especially when it's code that was written by
someone else, it's *super* easy to think something along the lines of "I can make this code so much better, it's shit!".

It may well be inefficient, confusing, overly complex, buggy, or any of a number of other things but to call it shit is
to ignore the context.

<!-- describe learning this while rewriting IPC/RPC code -->

<!-- explain why the first code written to do something often sucks -->

This may be obvious to some, but to many it's not so it seemed worth writing a short post on it as it's a really
important thing to understand and bear in mind, and it will make you a better teammate to those you code with if people
know you aren't going to insult their work.

I also wanted to write this post first, because I want to make sure people understand where I'm coming from in future
posts if I criticise code.
