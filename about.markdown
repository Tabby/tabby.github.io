Not to put too fine a point on it, I'm Tabby (fae/faer or they/them) and these are my thoughts!

I'm a trans and non-binary furry software engineer, and over the years there are two main things I've learned:

* The best thing anyone can do with knowledge is to share it
* It's important to open and authentic about who you are

I really like explaining things to people and am often quite good at it, at least when it comes to technical things,
and I want to be able to share what I learn with others more widely.

This is a space for me to write about things I think might be useful or interesting to others, or just that I think are
cool enough to want to write about, and most importantly where I can do so authentically without hiding who I am.

Mostly it'll be things about coding, living with ADHD, queerness, and so on as those
are the things I know about and think about the most, but there may be other things too.

You can find me on the Fediverse at [@Liophora@furry.engineer](https://furry.engineer/@Liophora)
