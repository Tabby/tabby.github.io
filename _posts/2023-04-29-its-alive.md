A long, long time ago, back when Google was still a useful search engine and MSN Messenger was all the rage, I, like a
number of my friends had a Livejournal. Nothing I ever wrote on there was of any great value, but over the past few
years as social media has proven to be complete mess at best, and actively harmful at worst, I've found myself wanting
to go back to writing long-form content again.

Inspired by Soatok's post ["The World Needs More Furry Bloggers"](https://soatok.blog/2020/06/15/the-world-needs-more-furry-bloggers/),
I've made myself a blog to do just that ^_^

I'm fed up with constraining what I write to fit character limits, jumping through hoops to appease algorithms, and I've
been putting off doing this for far too long, but now I finally have a space where I can express myself without
constraint, and I am looking forward to it!
